WebViewTest
===========

##Description

Small test app to try to solve a problem with a WebView. In some devices I've found a problem loading a local html file.

I was loading a index.html with a # parameter (index.html#{lang}), and with that test I want to try if the problem is the hash.

The device that could not load the page was a: HTC
